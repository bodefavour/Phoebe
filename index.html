    <h1>My Heartfelt Letter</h1>

    <!-- Letter paragraphs -->
    <div id="letter-container">
        <p>Phoebe, if you feel like I never loved you or made you feel loved, please don’t be quick to forget the past. I want you to think back to our times in school, if you can recall the memories, the places where I actually showed love. It wouldn't be right if I start listing them myself, but in every way I could, I sacrificed and showed love to you.</p>

<p>If you feel my love was just words without actions, really think back to those times in school, the times we spent alone, the things I did in secret. If you don’t count those as acts of love, then no problem – I did what I could, in the little ways I could.</p>

<p>I'm human too, and I needed love just as much. Every moment of anger, every outburst of emotion, and every long message explaining my feelings was coming from the pain I felt deep down. It wasn’t the best way to express it, but it stemmed from feeling unloved.</p>

<p>Every act of love from me was my way of showing how I also wanted to be loved. I yearned for love just as much as you did – every single time. If you feel I never loved you, don’t be quick to forget the past. Don’t let what happens now make you question whether I ever loved you.</p>

<p>Even now, if you think I don’t love you, you know that I’m still writing down my feelings about you. I’m writing a diary about us and all my experiences at Aro, just so you’d read it if we ever get back to school. I’m working on a website just for you. Every act of help, every action, was a display of love.</p>

<p>You know for sure I’d always pick you over anyone else. Remember when I went to the student camp and was thoughtful enough to pick flowers for you while coming back? The flower dried up before I arrived, but I still tried my best, even though I couldn’t afford a real one.</p>

<p>Every single morning I woke up, I prayed for you. Once, I was even moved to tears during prayer, asking God to make you happy and bless your family. Do you not count that as love? I fasted silently for you, even for three days when I saw how heartbroken you were over your sister’s admission. Was that not love?</p>

<p>Every word of support, every reminder of your bright future and how much God loves you – those were acts of love. Every time I put your needs above mine, wasn’t that love?</p>

<p>I remember the time I lied about saving money to buy something for myself, when I was actually planning to get a Bible for our sixth-month anniversary. But instead, I used that money to cover your transport because I wanted you to travel. I even starved myself the next day so you’d go home happy. Or the time I saved up because I saw how much you wanted to attend your dad’s induction, and I didn’t want money to be the reason you couldn’t go. Do you not count those things as love?</p>

<p>There were times when you needed something, and I wasn’t ashamed to ask my friends for help, just so you wouldn’t lack. These are just a few examples I could remember of how I showed love.</p>

<p>I’m not trying to justify myself or make myself look special. I just want to show you how much I loved you and remind you of the ways I showed love, in case you’ve forgotten.</p>

<p>And now, you question if I ever loved you or if I’m the right person for you. You’ve hardened your heart against me, convinced I’m a bad person, a bad partner. Even with all the sacrifices and acts of love, I’ve received comments like, “I don’t want you to help me again because I don’t want to feel indebted or entitled to your success.”</p>

<p>I’ve begged countless times for us to stay together whenever you wanted to leave. I’ve tried to hold us together, even when it was clear you didn’t want me. It still hurts remembering how you’d laugh at me when I did that, treating me like nothing – just because I valued you and our relationship.</p>

<p>You get upset when I say I don’t feel loved, but considering everything, I kept showing love even when I wasn’t appreciated. As much as you want to be treated special, I wanted that too.</p>

<p>I realized you never truly forgave me for everything that happened at the beginning of our relationship, and those memories have stayed with you, preventing you from loving me fully since then. But you’ve hurt me too, and I let it go, choosing to love you despite everything.</p>

<p>I may not fully know your perspective, but I hope you can see things from mine too. If I had been more abundant, I would have shown you even greater love.</p>

<p>You erased our chats every time we had a disagreement, but I never did. I never even changed your name, while you acted like we were nothing. You spoke badly about me to many of your friends, while I always made you sound like the most special person I’ve ever met, even when I spoke to Yeshua yesterday. I was never ashamed to show you off.</p>

<p>I guess you've ended us from your end now, even tho i would keep on trying for us, loving me is not hard, i really did not have high standards, and if I’ve hurt you or not been enough, I’m truly sorry. I’ve tried my best too.</p>
