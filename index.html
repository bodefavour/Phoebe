    <h1>My Heartfelt Letter</h1>
    <p>Phoebe, if you feel like I never loved you and never made you feel loved, don't be quick to forget the past
I want you to think back at times when were in school, if you can recall the memories, places in which I actually showed love
It wouldn't be right if I start saying them myself, in everyway I can I sacrificed and showed love to you 
If you feel my love were mere words and without actions, really think back about times in school, times we spent alone, those things I did in secret, if you don't count them as acts of love, then no problem, I did it in the little way I can 
I'm an human too, and I needed love too, every anger, every outburst of emotion, every long texts explaining their feelings is coming from pain I feel deep down
It's not the best way to express it, but it's out of feeling unloved

Every show or acts of love from me was me showing how I also want to be loved
I also yearn for love as much as you do, every single time
If you feel I never loved you, don't be quick to forget the past 

Don't let everything that happens now give you the thinking I never showed love or question if I ever loved you
Even now, if you think I don't love you
You're aware I'm writing down my feelings about you, I'm writing a diary about us, I'm writing all my experiences at Aro just so you'd read it if we get back to school
I'm working on a website just for you
Every help, every actions were acts of love
You know for sure I'd always pick you over any other person 
Remember when I went to students camp and I was thoughtful enough to pick flowers for you while I was coming, but the flower dried up before I came back, I cannot afford a real flower, but I did try my best
Every single morning I woke up I prayed for you even once when I was moved to tears during the prayer, I prayed to God you'd be happy and things would begin to go well for you and your family, you don't count that as love
Everytime I silently fasted and prayed for you
Even one time I saw how bad you were feeling for your sister and her not gaining admission, that I had to go on a 3 days fasting and prayer, and that's not love
Every word of support, making you realize that you have a bright future and God loves you so much to fail you
Everytime I put your own needs above mine, isn't that love?
Thinking of times I really did go a long way to show you love, the money I told you I was saving with you and lied I wanted to use to buy something for myself was to get a Bible for our 6th month anniversary but I converted it to your transport instead because I wanted you to travel that time, do you know I starved myself the next day, so you'd go home and be happy, thinking about how bad you wanted to attend your dad's induction that you were moved to tears, I decided to save up since it was money that made your mum not too allow you come, you don't count that as love
Scenarios where you'd be in need and ask from me and I wouldn't find it shameful to beg from my friends to help you get it so you wouldn't lack because I knew what position you were
Just some of all I could remember in ways I showed love
I'm not trying to justify myself or make myself look special 
I'm just showing you how much I love you and showed you love in case you forgot.

And you question if I loved you or whether I'm the the one for you
and you are hardened by the fact that I'm a bad person in your mind, 
and you believe I'm not a good partner
Despite all the sacrifices and love
I got statements like "I don't want you to help me again because I don't want to feel indebted to you and I don't want you to be entitled to my success"
Everytime I begged just so we'd stay together whenever you wanted to leave
Everytime I tried holding us together even when you clearly did not want me
It still rings in my mind how everytime you'd laugh at me whenever I did that and treat me like nothing everytime, just because I value you and our relationship 

You get angry everytime I say I don't feel loved, but in all considering all this, I keep doing it even when I really did not get appreciated 
In as much as you want to be treated special, I also yearn to be too
I realized you never did forgive me for everything I did at the beginning of the relationship and those memories always stick to your mind and made you unable to love me since then
but then you did things too, and I let all that slide and hardly talk about how I feel bad and loved you despite that

I might not know your own perspective, but view things from my own perspective too, if I was a little bit more abundant, I would have shown you even greater love

You cleared our chat everytime we've had a disagreement, but I never did and never even changed your name, but you instead acted like we were nothing, you talked bad about me to many of your friends of which I never did, everytime I told my friends or anybody about you, I made you the most special person I've ever met, even yesterday i talked with Yeshua about you
I was never ashamed of showing you
